# Robotics-Kinematics
This repository provides implementations of forward and inverse kinematics for a SCARA (Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm) robot. The kinematics algorithms are implemented in Python and can be used to calculate the position and orientation of the end effector given the joint angles (forward kinematics), or to determine the joint angles required to achieve a desired end effector position and orientation (inverse kinematics).

## Forward Kinematics
The forward kinematics algorithm calculates the position and orientation of the end effector of the SCARA robot based on the given joint angles. The forward kinematics implementation takes the joint angles as input and returns the position and orientation of the end effector. It utilizes the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters to model the kinematics of the robot. The algorithm involves matrix transformations and trigonometric calculations to determine the end effector position and orientation.

To use the forward kinematics implementation, follow these steps:

Open the forward_kinematics.py file in the repository.
Input the joint angles for your SCARA robot.
Run the script.
The script will output the position and orientation of the end effector based on the given joint angles.
## Inverse Kinematics
The inverse kinematics algorithm calculates the joint angles required to achieve a desired end effector position and orientation for the SCARA robot. The inverse kinematics implementation takes the desired position and orientation of the end effector as input and returns the corresponding joint angles. It also utilizes the DH parameters to model the robot's kinematics. The algorithm involves solving trigonometric equations to determine the joint angles that achieve the desired end effector position and orientation.

To use the inverse kinematics implementation, follow these steps:

Open the inverse_kinematics.py file in the repository.
Input the desired position and orientation of the end effector for your SCARA robot.
Run the script.
The script will output the joint angles required to achieve the desired end effector position and orientation.
Please note that these implementations are simplified and may not cover all possible scenarios or edge cases. Advanced algorithms and additional constraints may be required for more complex robotic systems.

Feel free to explore the code and modify it according to your specific needs and requirements.
